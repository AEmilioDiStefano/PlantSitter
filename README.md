# PlantSitter

PlantSitter is an embedded system able to trigger the execution of processes meant to maintain an optimal growing climate in controlled agricultural environments based on changes in air temperature and humidity levels (a smart greenhouse system). Whether you’re producing agricultural procudts or you just need a reliable system to take care of your house plants while you’re on vacation, PlantSitter is your ideal solution for maintaining plant health through the triggering of climatization control processes based on sensor input.

PlantSitter can also be used for the DIY curing of preserved meats such as Cappicola and Serrano ham. Just put the circuit and the heating/cooling/humidifying/drying in a closed environment with dimensions apropriate for the strength of your heating/cooling/humidifying/drying components.
